# üöÄ Docker Learning Series: Session 2

### üéØ Topic: From Virtual Machine Struggles to Docker Magic

Welcome to **Session 2** of our Docker learning series!

This session provided a practical understanding of how containerization ‚Äî especially using Docker ‚Äî simplifies development and deployment compared to traditional virtual machines.

---

## ‚ùì Discussion Questions

### 1. What is WSL and how does it help run Linux environments inside Windows?

- Explore how Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) enables developers to run a Linux distribution natively on Windows without dual-boot or VM setups.

---

### 2. What is Docker and why is it preferred over VMs for app deployment today?

- Compare Docker containers vs traditional virtual machines.
- Discuss resource efficiency, startup time, portability, and consistency.

---

### 3. What are the limitations of using WSL for production workloads?

- Understand the drawbacks of using WSL in production, such as networking complexity, hardware access, systemd support, and security limitations.

##  Scenario-Based Questions

###  Scenario 1: Docker Container Not Accessible

**Scenario:**

You‚Äôve deployed an NGINX container using the command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```

But when accessing http://localhost:8080, the browser shows "This site can‚Äôt be reached".

Question:
What steps would you take to troubleshoot this issue? Mention how networking works in Docker + WSL.


###  Scenario 2: Docker Installation Issues

**Scenario:**

A teammate tries to install Docker Desktop but gets an error that Hyper-V is disabled, and Docker won‚Äôt start.

Question:

What would you check first? How can WSL2 resolve this issue, and what settings should be enabled during installation?
